// Example: Using the console
// console.log("Hello World!");

// !! PRACTICE EXERCISE 1.1 !!

// 1. Open the browser console, type 4 + 10, and press Enter. What do you see as the response?

// 2. Use the console.log() syntax, placing a value within the rounded brackets. 
// Try entering your name with quotes around it (this is to indicate the fact that 
// it's a text stringâ€”we'll get to this in the next chapter).

// console.log("Bianca");

// !! PRACTICE EXERCISE 1.2 !!

// 1. Open your code editor and create an HTML file

// 2. Within your HTML file, set up the HTML tags, doctype, HTML, head, and 
// body, and then proceed and add the script tags.

// 3. Place some JavaScript code within the script tags. You can use console.
// log("hello world!").

// !! PRACTICE EXERCISE 1.3 !!

// 1. Create a separate file called app with the extension .js.

// 2. Within the .js file, add some JavaScript code.

// 3. Link to the separate .js file within the HTML file you created in Practice 
// exercise 1.2.

// 4. Open the HTML file within your browser and check to see whether the 
// JavaScript code ran properly

// !! PRACTICE EXERCISE 1.4 !!

// 1. Add a new statement to your JavaScript code by setting a variable value. 
// Since we will cover this in the next chapter, you can use the following line: 
// let a = 10;

// 2. Add a comment at the end of the statement indicating that you set a value of 
// 10.

// 3. Print the value using console.log(). Add a comment explaining what this 
// will do.

// 4. At the end of your JavaScript code, use a multiple-line comment. In a real 
// production script, you might use this space to add a brief outline of the 
// purpose of the file.

// /*console.log(let a = 10); 
// (set value to 10)
// (prints value of a to console)*/

// Example: Prompts
// prompt("Hi, how are you?");

// Example: Random Numbers
// console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()*100));

// !! CHAPTER PROJECT !! 

// Create an HTML file and create a separate JavaScript file. Then, connect to the 
// JavaScript file from the HTML file.

// 1. In the JavaScript file, output your name into the console and add a multiple-line comment to your code

// 2. Try commenting out the console message in your JavaScript file so that 
// nothing shows in the console.

// !! SELF-CHECK QUIZ !!

// 1. What is the HTML syntax to add an external JavaScript file?
/* The HTML syntax to add an external JS file is using the <script src=""></script> tags. 
The name of the JS file goes between the "". */
// CORRECT

// 2. Can you run JavaScript in a file with a JS extension in your browser?
// Yes you can.
// INCORRECT. You cannot.

// 3. How do you write a multiple-line comment in JavaScript?
// Between /* */.
// CORRECT

//4. What is the best way to remove a line of code from running that you might 
// want to keep as you debug?
// By commenting the code out either with //.
// CORRECT
